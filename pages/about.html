<p>Have you ever misplaced something valuable on campus and wished there was an easy way to get it back? Look no further! The BRAC University Lost and Found website is here to assist you in reuniting with your lost items. We understand how distressing it can be to lose something important, and our dedicated team is committed to helping you recover your belongings swiftly and efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>
<p>At BRAC University Lost and Found, our mission is to provide a centralized platform where students, faculty, and staff can report lost items and find their misplaced belongings. We aim to create a community-driven approach to lost and found services, fostering a culture of honesty and responsibility. Our team is dedicated to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and confidentiality throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Report a Lost Item:</strong> If you've lost something on campus, don't worry! Visit our website and fill out a simple form providing essential details about your lost item. The more accurate the information, the better chances we have of reuniting you with your belongings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search for Found Items:</strong> Found an item that doesn't belong to you? Kudos to your honesty! Report the found item on our website, describing it in as much detail as possible. This way, we can match it with a missing item report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matching Process:</strong> Our team works diligently to match lost item reports with the ones for found items. When we find a potential match, we'll reach out to you via the contact information provided in your report. Confidentiality is a priority, and your personal information will only be shared with the owner of the found item or the claimant of the lost item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Item:</strong> Once a match is confirmed, you can come to our Lost and Found office on campus to reclaim your belongings. Please bring a valid ID for verification purposes. Our team will be there to assist you throughout the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Donations and Disposal:</strong> Unclaimed found items that are not matched with lost item reports will be kept for a specified period. After that, usable items may be donated to local charities, while perishables or unusable items will be disposed of responsibly.</p>
</li>
